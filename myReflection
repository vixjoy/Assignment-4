my Reflection:
  I spent a very long time trying to debug my code. 
  I had an error in the update function where I made a myListing.create but I failed to make a myListing.save.
  Before I fixed that error I was passing no test cases. 
  After, I was getting a duplicate tuple error which I posted on piazza.
  I deleted the duplicate and then passed all the test cases.
